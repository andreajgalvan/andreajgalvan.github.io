						<i>Graphic Design - Spring PBL</i><br/>
						<small><i>Teamwork/Collaboration - Freshman Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: In a group, create a Photoshop tutorial for the 2012 IT Conference; you'll be teaching visiting seventh graders about the importance of being a good graphic designer.</p>
						<p>Reflection: This was the beginning of stressful conferences for me. All the work was done in good time but I was so terrified that we wouldn't get our message across. I don't think we did, but the day itself was pretty fun.</p>
						<p>The only photos I have of this are from the pre-conference shenanigans.

						<i>Graphic Design - Illustrator Box Person</i><br/>
						<small><i>Use of Resources - Freshman Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Gather a bunch of references and sharpen up your Illustrator skills, because it's time for a contest! Use everything you know to create a printable, foldable person. (If you search "papercraft" on google, you'll find out what I mean.) At the end, everyone votes and the winning foldable will be displayed big-scale in the building.</p>
						<p>Reflection: I WON! Unfortunately, my foldable was never displayed on a larger scale, but I'm still proud of myself for winning. A LOT of time and effort went into that project, and I'm happy with the ending result. During sophomore year I entered it into the Scholastic Art and Writing contest, but I didn't win. I guess my Illustrator skills as a freshman were really good in comparison to everyone else; they've improved a lot more now, though.</p>
						<p>You can view and print out my box person <a href="img/hs/BP1.png" target="_blank">here.</a> Instructions for folding are <a href="img/hs/BP2.png" target="_blank">here.</a>
