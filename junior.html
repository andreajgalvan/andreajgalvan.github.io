						<i>Typography Project</i><br/>
						<small><i>Content Knowledge - Junior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Give a five minute presentation on a font and do something creative with it.</p>
						<p>Reflection: I worked really hard on this presentation and it turned out great. I made a process video for the collage I created using the font, and it looks amazing.</p>

						<i>Illustrator Banner</i><br/>
						<small><i>Content Knowledge - Junior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Make your surroundings less boring using Adobe Illustrator. If everything goes smoothly, these poster boards will be up for a long time.</p>
						<p>Reflection: The banner turned out amazing! I'm really proud of all the effort I put into it.  It's hanging up right now and as I type, I'm looking right at it and I'm smiling.</p>

						<i>Web Development 2 - Congressional App Challenge</i><br/>
						<small><i>Presentation Skills - Junior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Use all your jQuery skills to create an app, and enter it into a contest under Congress.  Our idea started with my dreams of seeing my favorite boy bands in concert, so we made an app that lets the user view which concerts are available in the area.  </p>
						<p>Reflection: The app turned out really cute and I'm incredibly proud of all the effort put into it.  There's so much content and there's not much styling, but it's an app - there's not much styling really needed.</p>

						<i>Media for the Web - Autism Awareness Animation</i><br/>
						<small><i>Presentation Skills - Junior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Help change an autistic student's life forever. Create a website and an animation about autism awareness.</p>
						<p>Reflection: This is by far the most rewarding experience I've ever been part of.  It opened my eyes so much and I learned so much about autism.  I also learned a lot about my capability with animation and patience.  Apparently, I am an incredibly patient person who will do whatever she needs to do in order to meet deadlines and create the best project she can.</p>

						<i>Web Development 2 - 2013 Portfolio Design</i><br/>
						<small><i>Presentation Skills - Junior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: For midterm exams, have a completely updated portfolio.  Now's your chance to make a new design and show off your best work.</p>
						<p>Reflection: I don't like the design anymore, but I didn't know I was capable of making such a cute one! Even though it was inspired by Assassin's Creed, it still turned out really nice.  I think it's more suited for a blog now, so I'm trying to come up with a more mature design. (update: i think i got it.)</p>

						<i>AP United States History - What Makes You Super Glue - 1950s Advertisements</i><br/>
						<small><i>Presentations Skills - Junior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Find an invention from the 1950s and create an advertisement for it.  You can use any medium you want.</p>
						<p>Reflection: I decided to do an animation with a song parody for What Makes You Beautiful by One Direction.  It turned out really nice, and it has over 400 views on YouTube! I'm very happy with my work ethic and I'm even more proud of my final product.</p>

						<i>Web Development 2 Lab - Girls in Tech Website Design/Spring PBL </i><br/>

						<p>Description: It's Spring PBL time again, and this year's challenge is to design a website that will best represent the school for the Girls in Tech 2014 conference.  Time is limited and the site needs to have all of the workshops, sponsors, and people involved listed on it.</p>
						<p>Reflection: This site had so much work put into it and I'm glad it turned out the way that it did. The design turned out amazing and my teacher told us that the public loves it!</p>

						<i>Web Development II - Cape Cod Academy Site Design</i><br/>
						<small><i>Work Ethic - Junior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: In a group, create a fully functioning website for a fictional client in order to prepare for the year.</p>
						<p>Reflection: I was super stressed out for this project because my group members didn't really work well together and got distracted often except for one. We got the work done, and it was presentable and acceptable. My role as project leader didn't really do much, but I did a lot of coding and supporting for all my members. We ended with a good site that everyone in the class loved, and this one is actually live! This is my first live website and I'm really excited about it. I know I'm capable of much better products now, and once I get those up and running I'll be even more proud.</p>

						<i>Web Development II - Fun Camp, Inc. Site Design</i><br/>
						<small><i>Work Ethic - Junior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: In a group, create a fully functioning website (IN WORDPRESS) for an actual client. It must apply to the target audience (potentional donators) in an appealing way.</p>
						<p>Reflection: I think my stress levels were even higher for this project. My group worked (mostly)	well together, but I had to do most of the Wordpress stuff by myself. That was really draining, because I had a bunch of other stuff going on in my AP classes and such. We haven't finished it yet (1/14) but my final product is pretty close to done.</p>

						<i>AP U.S. History - Andrew Jackson DBQ (Document Based Question)</i><br/>

						<p>Description: Answer this prompt using the given documents: 
							<blockquote>Jacksonian Democrats viewed themselves as the guardians of the United States Constitution, political democracy, individual liberty, and equality of economic opportunity. In light of the following documents and your knowledge of the 1820’s and 1830’s to what extent do you agree with the Jacksonians' view of themselves?</blockquote></p>
						<p>Reflection: This essay took me twelve hours to complete, and it was totally worth it! I really went in depth on everything and received a high score, much to my happiness. </p>

						<i>AP Language and Composition - Argument Timed Writing</i><br/>
						<small><i>Writing Skills - Junior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: <blockquote>In his 2004 book, <i>Status Anxiety,</i> Alain de Botton argues that the chief aim of humorists is not merely to entertain but "to convey with impunity messages that might be dangerous or impossible to state directly." Because society allows humorists to say things that other people cannot or will not say, de Botton sees humorists as serving a vital funtion in society. <br/> Think about the implications of de Botton's view of the role of humorists(cartoonists, stand-up comics, satirical writers, hosts of television programs, etc.). Then write an essay that defends, challenges, or qualifies de Botton's claim about the vital role of humorists.  Use specific, appropriate evidence to develop your position.</blockquote></p>
						<p>Reflection: Apparently I did really well on this essay. I can't see it because I am bad at identifying improvement in my writing, but my teacher thought that I improved a LOT in comparison to my previous essays. She said the argument was a lot stronger than before. I believe her, and I'm proud of myself for making such an improvement.</p>

						<i>AP Language and Composition - Modes Project</i><br/>
						<small><i>Writing Skills - Junior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Write 5 essays and 17 precis all for the sake of understanding the modes of rhetoric.</p>
						<p>Reflection: This project wasn't one of my favorites, but some of my best work came out of it.  There wasn't much direction but I'm happy I finished everything within the deadlines and I had some great writing.  I think the best part about this project was my overall theme for the 5 essays, which was "gaming." (Never in my life did I think I would be writing about playing video games. It was awesome.) That's probably why my best writing is in this project.</p>
