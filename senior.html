						<i>US Government H - Create a Country Presentation</i><br/>
						<small><i>Teamwork/Collaboration - Senior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: In teams, create a country based on whatever you want. Use all of the things you have learned up to this point and have a lot of fun with it.</p>
						<p>Reflection: This project is one of my more hated ones, but it was still really well done. My group did an excellent job in giving a charismatic presentation that left everyone laughing and questioning our sanity. (The country was goat based. This was not my idea.) I used a bunch of my graphic design skills and art skills to create a flag and opening banner that turned out amazing! Not gonna lie, I would do this again, just not with my group. I also now hate goats. </p>

						<i>English 12 H - Dracula Group Project</i><br/>
						<small><i>Use of Resources - Senior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Given a packet of information and the novel <i>Dracula</i> by Bram Stoker, answer a series of questions in order to earn seals and give yourself more information to work with for the essay. </p>
						<p>Reflection: I used my research extremely well and helped my team get the maximum number of seals. I gathered a bunch of information to use for my essay, and I used almost all of that.  Our final grade reflected just how hard we worked to fully answer the questions and it was absolutely perfect.</p>

						<small><i>Work Ethic - Senior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Given the client's information, create a website that best suits their needs</p>
						<p>Reflection: This assignment was actually under a bit of time pressure because I spent a couple of days goofing off. I actually created a really nice website design for the site and it will be live within the school year! I am so excited!</p>

						<i>English 12 Honors - Dracula Essay</i><br/>
						<small><i>Writing Skills - Senior Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Answer this prompt: 
							<blockquote>How was Dracula scary ? (full prompt, type it up later)</blockquote> <br> using the information you were given and the information you gathered over the group project days.
						</p>
						<p>Reflection: I worked my absolute hardest on this essay, and I got the highest grade I've gotten on an essay ever in my high school career. I'm extremely proud of myself because I actually motivated myself to do something amazing and it worked out perfectly. I know for a fact that I'll be working this hard on all of my essays for this year and I hope that I'll be able to get some scholarships from them!</p>
