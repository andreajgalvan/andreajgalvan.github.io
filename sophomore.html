						<i>Animation I - Hunger Games Flash Project</i><br/>
						<small><i>Content Knowledge - Sophomore Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: With a partner, animate a chapter of The Hunger Games (in Flash CS6) for a teacher's English class. It must accurately portray the chapter.</p>
						<p>Reflection: Since we had nine weeks  to work on this project, I think my partner and I did pretty well. We were among the few who actually managed to finish the entire project with a day to spare. We wasted little to no time working and we ended with a very nice result.</p>

						<i>World History Honors - International Economic Summit (IES)</i><br/>
						<small><i>Teamwork/Collaboration - Sophomore Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: In a group, represent a country as economic advisors. Spend an entire day trading and forming alliances with other represented countries in order to increase your country's standard of living. (My group was the country Georgia, and we had a lot of trading to do.)</p>
						<p>Reflection: My group didn't follow our plan 100% and our allies weren't that helpful, but we somehow managed to slightly improve the standard of living through intense trading sessions and crazy calculations. There was a lot of yelling and excuse me's, but all in all the day was very fun. I can't say I'd try it again in a heartbeat, because I wouldn't.</p>

						<i>Website Science I - Spring PBL</i><br/>
						<small><i>Teamwork/Collaboration - Sophomore Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: For the <a href="http://swcta.net/teachers/changcl/IT2013/" target="_blank">Girls in Tech IT Conference</a>, the entire sophomore class was split into several groups. My group was a small part of the App Building portion; we were to create assets to use in the program Scratch. This conference was similar to the freshman year conference because seventh graders still came to the school; this time, though, it was exclusively girls.</p>
						<p>Reflection: This conference was less stressful because I knew what to do, but it was still pretty stressful. Working with the upperclassmen scared me; all of them were so uptight and angry all the time. Somehow I pulled through and persuaded a few girls to come to the school, which I'm very proud of. </p>

						<i>Animation 1 - Sketchbook Assignment, Quarter 3</i><br/>
						<small><i>Use of Resources - Sophomore Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Using a list of themes, draw 6+ sketches. Use any materials you want, and put a lot of effort into each sketch.</p>
						<p>Reflection: I honestly believe some of my best art came out of this prompt. My creative ability pretty much exploded from the lack of limits. I picked around 10 themes from the 40 listed, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Some day I'm going to dig up that list and continue drawing from it, because I really want to continue improving my artistic ability and I think using a list like that would help out.</p>
						<p>Unavailable for viewing because these sketches aren't my best.</p>

						<i>English 10 Honors - Song Project</i><br/>
						<small><i>Work Ethic - Sophomore Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: Pick a song that appeals to you and present it in a unique way. (I chose to make a website.) Include song lyrics, a music video (if applicable), literary elements, artist information, and an analysis. </p>
						<p>Reflection: I'm very proud of the website that I created. It is one of the few themes I have with a full-window background, and it looks amazing. There isn't much fluidity and responsiveness because I had just learned how to created fixed divs in Dreamweaver CS6, a website designing program we learned that year. Still, I think it turned out great for just a couple of weeks' work.</p>

						<i>Website Science I - QR Code Project</i><br/>
						<small><i>Work Ethic - Sophomore Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: In a group, create a QR code and video for one of the new teachers at the school. The QR code must accurately describe the courses the teacher provides and the video must have an interview from the teacher.</p>
						<p>Reflection: This project went really well. One of my group members switched schools halfway through the year, so I was left with his role. Even though it was my first time working with iMovie, I managed to create a socially acceptable video for each QR code. My group had two teachers, so we were twice as stressed, but we pulled through and got everything done correctly and well.</p>
						<p>View the QR codes <a href="img/hs/QR1.png" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="img/hs/QR2.png" target="_blank">here.</a> Both are fully functional and will link to each video.</p>

						<i>English 10 Honors - Utopia/Hell Essay</i><br/>
						<small><i>Writing Skills - Sophomore Year</i></small>
						<p>Description: In groups of three, write an essay describing a personal utopia or a personal hell. Present it in an interesting way.</p>
						<p>Reflection: I think the essay would have been better if I had contributed more; I was really stressed out at the time and so focused on finishing my sketchbook assignment that I kind of neglected it. We got a high score on the essay, though, which was nice. I did create our UTOPIA in Minecraft, which I still don't understand why I did. We got a great response from both the teacher and the class, so I'm thankful for that.</p>
